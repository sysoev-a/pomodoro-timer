# pomodoro-timer
Code for Arduino-based [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

The sketch is to be compiled and uploaded with [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software#download).

Key components:
* Iskra Neo (AMP-B030)
* Troyka-Shield LP (AMP-B071)
* Troyka-Quad Display V2 [Red] (AMP-B086-[R])
* Troyka-[White] Led (AMP-B005-[W])
* Troyka-Led Button [Red] (AMP-B077-[R])

Note: the code is based on delay(), thus the timer is not very precise.
